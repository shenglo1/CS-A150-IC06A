        - Each axis goes from -1 to +1, center at 0,0.
    * Henry Draper number, a unique identifier for the star.
    * The magnitude (or brightness) of the star.
    * The Harvard Revised number, another identifier.
    * The seventh field exists only for a small number of stars 
      and is a semicolon-separated list of names for a star. 
        - A star may have several names.
